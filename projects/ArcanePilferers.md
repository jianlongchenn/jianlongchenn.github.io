## Overview
**Arcane Pilferers** is a 2D platformer built by a **team of four** during an **8-week game development class** in Unity.  
Legends speak of a colossal, universe-spanning tree. By navigating dimensional rifts and channeling three magical crystals near each rift’s opening, adventurers can reach the tree’s core where a grand treasure lies.

You’ll battle foes across shifting worlds, **harvest souls** to power spells, and **channel mana at shrines** to upgrade yourself **every run**. Even in defeat, progression persists—capturing a roguelike loop of steady growth.

- Additional **playable characters** and **upgrade paths**  
- A more **unified art style**, improved **shaders** and **lighting**
