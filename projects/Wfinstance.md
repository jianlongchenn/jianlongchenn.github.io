## Overview
This project was completed as part of ICS 496, my Computer Science capstone course. The goal was to simulate real-world software development, from planning to delivery, in a collaborative team environment.  

The **WfInstances Browser** is a web application that allows researchers to browse, download, simulate, and visualize workflow instances from **WfCommons** repositories. Our team focused on improving usability and implementing new features.
